Homework 6 Assignment: Portal Platformer

In order to play our game, all you need to do us run the file portal_final.py which imports our list of levels and the images necessary. You just need to be in the same directory as our world.py file and our mp3 and images.

For our game, you are a companion cube and it is your goal to get to the chocolate cake with pink icing at the end of each level. How you accomplish this is up to you. You can jump and move side to side. You also have access to portals. Just point and click and a left-click will make one portal appear, a right click another. Entering one portal will make you come out of the second portal, and vice versa.

If you get stuck in between portals, that would be game over. We hope you enjoy our game!
